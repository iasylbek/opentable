# Open Table API app

This app is available online: http://opentable.surge.sh/

### Note:

Part of the task: "The Name, Cuisine Types and Rating of the restaurant are displayed" <br/>
Answer: Cuisine Types and Ratings was not available as part of OpenTable API. This is probably from different API.

## Technical questions

1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

- This took me around 5-6 relaxed hours on weekend. During that time I was eating, drinking coffee and spending time with my family.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

- I didn't used last features, but usually it's ES6 classes, arrow functions, spreading

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

- Never had to do this, but I would use Dev Tools (in Chrome, Firefox) using sections of "Performance" and "Network"

4. How would you improve the API that you just used?

- First of business/restaurants images, they are missing.
- Also I would add system of ratings, reviews.
- Menu options available.
- Hours of operation.
- Add more documentation.

5. Please describe yourself using JSON.
